# NLP
Lexicon SA VS Machine Learning SA

This project mainly to study sentiment analysis of hotel reviews using two methods which are lexical and machine learning method.

# Procedure
This project has been categorized into four parts.

#### Part I
Using Hotel reviews dataset create lexicon. 
#### Part II
Then use Spacy to do classification. Accuracy is calculated for later use (compare with machine learning method)
#### Part III
By using Machine learning method (NaiveBayes) to do hotel reviews sentiment analysis. Difference algorithms such as Bag of words, TF-IDF and word embedding (Doc2vec) are used.
#### Part IV
Compare the accuracy
Compare the accuracy of both methods (lexical analysis and machine learning). However for this part, more classification method are included to determine the best classifier for hotel reviews dataset. The included classifiers are Logistic Regression, NaiveBayes and SVM.
